# Algorithms Portfolio

A curated collection of concise Python implementations from **CS 325: Analysis of Algorithms** at Oregon State University.  
Each script demonstrates core algorithmic design patterns — including recursion, dynamic programming, greedy methods, and graph algorithms — with clear documentation and problem-focused code structure.

## Topics & Implementations

### Divide and Conquer
- **KthElement.py** – Finds the k-th smallest element in two sorted arrays using recursive partitioning.

### Dynamic Programming
- **DNAMatch.py** – Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) applied to DNA sequence alignment.  
- **MaxSet.py** – Maximum weighted independent set on a path (non-adjacent subset sum).  
- **Amount.py** – Backtracking + DP pruning for subset-sum combinations.

### Greedy Algorithms
- **FeedDog.py** – Optimal resource allocation using greedy matching (similar to cookie assignment).  
- **PowerSet.py** – Generates all subsets of a set using recursive backtracking.

### Graph Algorithms
- **MST.py** – Prim’s algorithm for the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).  
- **Puzzle.py** – BFS pathfinding through a grid maze using adjacency list construction.  
- **MinPuzzle.py** – Dijkstra’s algorithm variant minimizing maximum “effort” difference across cells.  
- **TSP.py** – Nearest Neighbor heuristic for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
